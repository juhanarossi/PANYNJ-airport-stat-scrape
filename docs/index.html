                    <h2>JFK Takes Off, Helsinki Flies Low</h2>
                    <h3>The recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic differs
                         drastically at two different airports serving as major international gateways in their respective home countries.
                         Traffic at John F. Kennedy International airport in New York approaches its pre-pandemic level while it
                         lags
                         at
                         Helsinki airport in Finland.</h3>
                    <p>The constant drone of airliners’ jet engines on the skies above world’s major cities subsided suddenly in the spring 2020 when travel restrictions and lockdowns stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic led into a precipitous reduction in air travel.<br>
                              Now almost three years later the steady drone has returned to skies above the flights paths of planes departing from and arriving at the John F. Kennedy International Airport. In November last year the airport, colloquially known as JFK, recorded a higher total monthly passenger figure in a comparison to a corresponding monthly passenger figure in 2019 for the first time since the end Covid-19 pandemic and consequent recovery of air traffic.<br>
                              The mood and passenger figures are different 4,100 miles away from JFK at Helsinki airport, which is Finland’s main airport and gateway to abroad. A firm and sustained recovery in passenger traffic has eluded Helsinki airport, abbreviated as HEL, in comparison to JFK.<br>
                              I experienced this with all my senses when I travelled to Helsinki for a winter break from my studies in the New York City. The soundscape in Helsinki was much more quiet than in New York City since there were fewer airliners in the skies. Furthermore, I saw far fewer passenger in the Helsinki airport’s departure halls and concourses far fewer passengers than they could comfortably accommodate.<br>
                              Traffic statistics confirm the difference between JFK and Helsinki in the extent of recovery from the Covid-19 induced nadir. Helsinki airport’s total annual passenger figure for 2022 was 58.9 percent of the corresponding figure for 2019, the last normal year prior to Covid-19 pandemic. In comparison, the same figure for JFK was 88.2 percent.

                    <p>Traffic at John F. Kennedy or JFK, the largest international airport serving the New York
                         City is
                         making a steady recovery. At Helsinki aiport traffic still lags sharply its pre-pandemic.
                         This
                         is
                         chiefly due Russia's invasion in Ukraine, which closed the Russian airspace from European
                         carriers.
