# Airport Data Practice 
## Technical Description
This repo contains a bits of code that I wrote to practice data analysis and visualization. It has script for a simple scrape template and some ´ggplot2´ visualizations.
## Overview
I wanted to compare how traffic at [Helsinki](https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/helsinki-airport) and [John F. Kennedy](https://www.jfkairport.com/) airports had recovered from their respective Covid-19 troughs. The data would've could have been accessed and hand-curated fairly easily, but I wanted to practice scraping, so I wrote a simple template for scraping the data from [the Port Authority New York New Jersey website](https://www.panynj.gov/airports/en/statistics-general-info.html). Both the raw and refined data for JFK is available in the ´JFK_traffic-stats´ folder. The raw data is in the ´pdf´ files and refined data in the ´csv´ file.
